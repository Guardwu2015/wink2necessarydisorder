# wink2necessarydisorder
simplexnoise and lerp experiments with P5, wink to Necessary Disorder project of Etienne Jacob

---

This project is experimental and largely inspired by the works of Etienne Jacob, 
on his project "Necessary Disorder".

Etienne came to the CreativeCodeParis meetup, in december 2017, to show his works around
generated shapes (on Processing) and anime GIFs.

I liked a lot the examples of Etienne, so I tried in that project to adapt the sketches 
of Etienne to the specificites of P5.js. 

It was very fun and interesting to do that. I tried to optimize the code to have a 
good fluidity of animation, with a pleasant interactivity. I think it's not too bad.

Probably the most difficult job was to adapt in Javascript the simplex algorithm
(written by Kurt Spencer) that Etienne used in several sketches.
